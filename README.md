Mesekai is a real-time 3D virtual avatar and world web application. Users can select from a list of avatar and world presets for their digital persona and environment. Avatar limbs, fingers, and facial expressions are controlled by the user's physical body through webcam video. The app is built using MediaPipe, Three.js, and React. The Mesekai team comes from a diverse background of technical experience and passions. We are web, database, user interface, computer graphics, and videogame designers and developers. We are excited about the prospect of entering a fantasy world built by our own ingenuity and imagination.
